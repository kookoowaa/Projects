Just wanted to let you know that my experience of shopping online at IKEA was really really bad. I am a fan of IKEA, so I am writing this in hopes that you can make the process better. 1. registration -- for some reason my email charleschun@gmail.com wouldn't register. Error comes up for looking up password and also for new registration. I was not mistaking it for the family log in. The customer service person I talked to couldn't fix it. I eventually re-registered under a different email sellingchuck@gmail.com. 2. there was an item that wouldn't add to the cart. It kept giving me an error. So I called customer service. They said they will get back to me, but I asked them to check again. They said it was out of stock. 3. I placed an order, it gave me an error. My card was charged, but the order was not confirmed. I called again. Later the email was sent. 4. I called to check the order, because of delivery. I had to cancel, because the order would not be delivered on time.
